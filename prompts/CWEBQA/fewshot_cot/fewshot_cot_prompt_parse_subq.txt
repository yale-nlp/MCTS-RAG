### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What was the initial number of trees in the grove?
Subanswer: Initially, there were 15 trees in the grove. The answer is: 15.
Subquestion: What is the total number of trees in the grove after the workers finished planting?
Subanswer: After planting, the total number of trees in the grove is 21. The answer is: 21.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
Subanswer: We can find out by subtracting the initial number of trees from the total number after planting. So, 21 - 15 = 6. Therefore, the workers planted 6 trees today. The answer is: 6.
